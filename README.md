# AI-Image-Classifier

This project is a web application that uses a pre-trained deep learning model (MobileNetV2) to classify images.

**This project was built to demonstrate my skills for the Google Developer Group (GDG) at UTM.**

### ##  Technologies Used

* **Python:** The core programming language.
* **TensorFlow (Keras):** To load and use the pre-trained `MobileNetV2` model.
* **Streamlit:** To build and deploy the interactive web app UI.
* **Pillow & NumPy:** For loading and preprocessing the images.

### ##  Core Concept: Transfer Learning

This project uses **transfer learning**. Instead of building a model from scratch, I used the `MobileNetV2` model, which was pre-trained by Google on the ImageNet dataset (1.4 million images). My app simply acts as a front-end, allowing anyone to use this powerful model.
